1. what differences exist between pointer variables and arrays;
    A pointer variable is a single value while an array points to the first element in a series of values

2. what differences exist between pointer variables and reference variables;
    A pointer can be initialized as 0 (or null). A reference must be initialized on construction.

3. how element [3][2] is reached
  a: for the variable `int array[20][30]';
      From the address of array, go to the offset of the 4th row (3 * 30 ints further). And then add an offset of 2 ints to get reach requested element.

  b: for the variable `int *pointer[20]';
      From the address of the pointer go to its 4th element (offset of 3 since a pointer has a size of 1). Then add to that value an offset of 2 ints to reach the requested element.

4. what is meant by `pointer arithmetic';
    Pointer arithmetic refers to the adding or substracting of values to pointers to reach that number of elements beyond or in front of the pointer.
