Although the program apparently runs OK, there's a serious flaw in its design. What is it?
    If finder.cc is linked before main.cc the program runs fine, however if finder.cc is linked after main.cc the phonebook is constructed before the static s_finder is, this results in the pointer to the array of pairs is reset to pointing to 0.

And how would you repair the flaw?
    The issue can be fixed by initializing s_finder inline.
