• declare (!) a variable ptr pointing to rows of 8 doubles

    extern double (*ptr)[8];

• declare a variable ptr pointing to an array holding the addresses of series of doubles. The series of doubles may consist of different numbers of doubles

    extern double **ptr;

• declare a pointer ptr that may point to arrays of immutable pointers to arrays of mutable pointers to immutable std::string objects.

    extern std::string const **const *ptr;

• declare a function fun expecting no parameters, returning a matrix of 6 x 6 std::string objects

    std::string (*fun())[6];

• assume that the following typedef has been defined:
      typedef std::string (*StringMat)[6];
  Declare a function fun as in the previous item, now using StringMat

    StringMat fun();

• complete the following function by providing the initialization section of its for-statement (submit the completed function):

    void process(unsigned begin, unsigned end, char const *const *args)
    {
        for
        (
            char const *argsBegin = args[begin], *const argsEnd = args[end];
                argsBegin != argsEnd;
                    ++argsBegin
        )
            process(*argsBegin);
    }


• declare a function fun defining a parameter ptr which is an immutable pointer to NTBSs, returning one of these pointers as an immutable NTBS

    char const *fun(char **const ptr);
